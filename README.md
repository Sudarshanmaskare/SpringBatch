This is a Spring Batch hands-on Project to get a core idea of how it works. Using ETL Methodology for extracting data from CSV files, transforming it with the use of ItemProcessor, and loading it to any warehouse or S3 bucket.

Set Up Spring Batch Project:

First, I set up a new Spring Batch project using Spring Boot, including the necessary dependencies in my build file.
Define Batch Configuration:

I create a batch configuration class where I define the necessary beans, such as Job, Step, and the components for reading, processing, and writing data.
Configure CSV Reader:

I configure a FlatFileItemReader to read data from a CSV file. I specify the file location, define a line mapper to map CSV lines to domain objects and set any necessary properties.
Implement Data Processing:

I implement a custom ItemProcessor class to perform any necessary data processing or transformation. This class will be responsible for modifying the data before it's written to the target database.
Configure Database Writer:

I configure a RepositoryItemWriter or another suitable writer to write processed data to the target database. I set up any necessary properties, such as the repository and method name for saving data.
Run the Batch Job:

I create a main application class with a main method. Inside this method, I use the JobLauncher to run the batch job. The Spring Batch framework takes care of executing the defined steps, reading data from the CSV, processing it, and writing it to the database.
Verify Results:

After running the application, I verify the results by checking the target database to ensure that the data has been successfully loaded.
Handle Errors and Logging:

I incorporate error handling mechanisms, such as skip policies or listeners, to manage any issues that might occur during the batch processing. Additionally, I include logging statements to track the progress and identify any potential issues.
Enhance Performance (Optional):

If needed, I explore ways to enhance the performance of my batch job, such as parallel processing, chunk sizing adjustments, or optimization of database interactions.
Document and Share:

Finally, I document the configuration, dependencies, and any specific considerations in the project. This documentation can be shared with the team or stakeholders for better understanding and future reference.
By following these steps, I efficiently leverage the capabilities of Spring Batch to process data from a CSV file and load it into another database with ease and reliability.
